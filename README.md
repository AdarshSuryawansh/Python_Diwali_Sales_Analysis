## Project Overview
The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to analyze customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and sales performance during the Diwali festive season. By examining the dataset, we gain insights into:
- Gender- and age-based purchasing patterns.
- Popular product categories.
- Geographic distribution of sales.
- Customer occupation and its impact on purchase behavior.
- Overall sales performance in terms of orders and total revenue.

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization of sales distribution by gender, age, and occupation.
   - Analyzing sales across states and geographic zones.
   - Identifying top-selling product categories.
3. **Statistical Insights**: Deriving insights from trends in customer behavior and product preferences.
